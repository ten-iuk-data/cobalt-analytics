## Solution - Deployment Guide

This document provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the duplicate application identification solution in different environments (staging, preprod, or prod) using Terraform. The solution is designed to be easily deployed across these environments using the appropriate configuration files.

## Pre-requisites

1. **Terraform** is installed on your local machine.
2. **AWS CLI** is installed and configured to authenticate with the target AWS account.
3. **Access permissions** are in place for managing S3 buckets, IAM roles, Glue jobs, and other necessary AWS resources.

## Environment-Specific Configuration

The deployment is environment-specific, meaning each environment (staging, preprod, prod) will have its own configuration file. These configurations are defined in the following files:

- `backend_staging.hcl`
- `backend_preprod.hcl`
- `backend_prod.hcl`

Additionally, environment variables are defined in:

- `staging.tfvars`
- `preprod.tfvars`
- `prod.tfvars`

## Deployment Steps

Follow these steps to deploy the solution to your desired environment:

1. **Initialize Terraform**  
   Initialize Terraform for the selected environment by configuring the backend storage.

   ```bash
   terraform init -reconfigure -backend-config=backend_{environment}.hcl --input=false
Replace {environment} with the desired environment (e.g., staging, preprod, prod).

2. **Create a New Terraform Workspace**
    This step is optional and only required if you haven't set up the environment workspace before.
    terraform workspace new {environment}
    ```bash
    terraform workspace new {environment}
If the workspace already exists, proceed to the next step.

3. **Select the Workspace**
    Ensure that you are working in the correct environment by selecting the corresponding workspace.
    ```bash
    terraform workspace select {environment}

4. **Generate and Review the Execution Plan**
    Generate the execution plan using the environment-specific variable file to review the changes before applying them.
    ```bash
    terraform plan --input=false --var-file={environment}.tfvars

5. **Apply the Changes**
    Apply the Terraform configuration to deploy the Glue Job in the target environment.
    ```bash
    terraform apply --input=false --var-file={environment}.tfvars

6. **Monitor the Deployment**
    Once the deployment is successful, monitor the status of the Glue Job and other resources in the AWS Management Console or via the AWS CLI.


7. **Cleanup**
    ```bash
    terraform destroy --input=false --var-file={environment}.tfvars
