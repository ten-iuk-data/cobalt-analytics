Vehicles that collect these warrants are often uninsured, have neither MOT or road tax, and can be associated with crime. But finding and then fining these repeat offenders is difficult, as the details of their offences are held in many different places and not yet combined into a single penalty which could run to many £1000s for a single vehicle. These unpaid penalties currently exceeding £1b per annum must, if recovered, by law be used to fund transport developments. They are not ""a war on the motorist""

The National Persistent Evaders Database (NPED) - or what some call ""Santa's naughty list for vehicles"" - will securely blend offending vehicle data from multiple sources into one penalty , to reduce this loss. NPED will bring together all offending vehicle behaviour and generate income the same way as a credit reference agency does for individuals and businesses, but solely for vehicles

This project will firstly measure the scale of this issue -to raise market awareness- and then show through end to end demonstrations how we target enforcement against the worst offenders, and share intelligence with other agencies and the police. Later phases would then roll out the service nationally based on this evidence and institutional support.

The insights and evidence obtained through NPED will also be the foundation for engagement with Government for developing additional powers or new legislation to fully enable the weight of the law focussing on ""bad guys"" but without impacting normally compliant drivers who may have missed say just a single penalty - it will be fair.",,"47423","2023-11-01 00:00:00.000","OPEN",,,"Experimental development","Other transport","12931","Innovate UK Smart grants: June 2023",,,,"52.63","1","10094583","Identifying non-compliant vehicles in the community (phase 1a)","0",,"0","2023-08-24 12:37:45.000","2023-12-11 20:54:59.000"

"153215","64414","4"," An innovation to solve the unprecedented supply and demand issue for ventilators and other respiratory support machines, with a long term vision to mitigate future medical equipment shortfalls. ","Healthcare is a reactive industry by nature, constantly needing to shift and maximise limited resources to cater for surges in illness, disease or sudden disasters. COVID-19, a global respiratory disease pandemic has created a sudden, unprecedented need for more respiratory support machines, such as ventilators, in hospitals across the UK.

**VentaTrack's project is solving this unprecedented supply and demand issue for respiratory support when it is needed most and helping to prevent slow responses to medical equipment shortfalls in the future by** 1\. Maximising use of resources by live tracking all available machines/stock and ensuring each one gets the maximum use and 2\. Saving wasted time for clinical staff so they can have immediate access to the machine they need when they need it. The UK ranked 24th out of 31 in terms of ICU beds per head of population compared with other european countries prior to the COVID-19 outbreak and resources vary widely across hospitals and geographical areas.

**Dr Goldman, who is leading a COVID-19 unit at Whipps Cross hospital, had the idea for an innovation to help solve this significant patient safety issue she faced every day**. She and her team were struggling with tracking availability of machines for respiratory support for critically unwell patients. The makeshift spreadsheet they built themselves was time consuming to update, very error prone and had no traceability/record to help locate machines. Current systems that are meant to cover supply management only offer limited tools to list machine stocks with no way of locating them live.

**In just 1 week since the first conversation about this project, the team has launched a proof of concept at Whipps Cross with plans to roll-out throughout Barts Health NHS Trust (the largest NHS trust in England)**. By using the latest cloud and software technology to build a secure, dynamic system we have replaced the makeshift spreadsheet. Clinical and management teams now have access to all available machines and their locations to anticipate equipment short-falls and respond rapidly to patient needs. **After seeing the huge positive reaction and improvements from our trial, we realised that this is a tool that should be in every UK hospital, fast.** We don't know what will happen next with the COVID crisis, but we do know that this innovation will help the NHS be better equipped to handle whatever comes.","While the whole country is supporting our amazing NHS clinical staff to save as many lives as possible during the sudden COVID-19 pandemic, VentaTrack is building a platform that will help clinical staff save time and manage resources such as ventilators more effectively for critically ill patients.

**As COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, the sudden need for more ventilators and respiratory support in hospitals has resulted in staff needing to make the most out of every single piece of equipment, for every single minute of the day.** The problem they face is that they currently have no way of quickly locating available ventilators (and other respiratory devices) in their hospital so they can collect, use and then pass on the closest, most relevant machine as they need to. With most hospitals reporting a shortfall of machines, it has never been more important to make sure every available machine is being used in the most efficient way.

**A passionate Doctor leading a COVID-19 unit at Whipps Cross hospital, part of Barts Health NHS Trust in London, sought to solve this problem herself.** She saw the need to build an innovative solution that could be deployed quickly and safely. The solution needed to give a live view of all the respiratory support equipment across the department (especially as new ventilator deliveries are expected to start soon) and allow her team to locate machines instantly, tag machine types so that the right equipment gets to the right patients and flag when machines need maintenance, to get them back with patients as soon as possible. This is where our project comes in.

**In April 2020, we built a trial version of the platform that is now live at Whipps Cross and has already saved hours of time and potentially lives.** With the support of Innovate UK, we want to continue to improve the platform with features co-designed with medical teams, so it can scale to as many hospitals as possible throughout this crisis. As the system runs on the cloud, we can launch it into new hospitals remotely in a matter of hours and have a huge impact on the number of staff it helps and lives it saves.

Once we have scaled throughout UK hospitals, we want to add on more critical care equipment to the tracker to maximise more resources, ensure we can better prepare for future disasters and improve patient care.","**Is our project solving a real societal need that has emerged out of the COVID-19 pandemic?** Yes. This project is solving a critical need in the UK identified by a front line doctor, with an innovative approach that has already been proven on a small scale. No industry has been more severely impacted than the health service by the pandemic and we see our solution as something that can help the NHS adapt long term to the impact of what is happening.

**Is our idea a real innovation?** Yes. With the need highlighted by someone who is now using our trial system every day, our idea is the combination of clinical knowledge, software development expertise and business acumen. Having spoken to doctors at the front line, we know of no other system in use by the NHS with the capabilities we are developing. We are supporting clinical teams to evolve the way they operate and the ways hospitals manage scarce equipment both no and long term.

**Do we have the capacity to deliver the project now, during the crisis?** Yes. We have already deployed our trial system working remotely and can continue this working practice during the full project duration. Our team has committed the time required to hit our milestones, our combined experience means we have been realistic in what we can deliver with the resources we have available.

**The ability to start the project no later than June 2020:** Absolutely, we want to get this into as many hospitals as possible as fast as possible. We can start in May 2020, as we have everything we need to press go.

**Our project also aligns well to the 'Leading Edge Healthcare' Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund.** ""Individual patients need different types of medicines and treatments depending on their disease or condition. There is a big challenge for industry in manufacturing these various medicines and getting them to the patient at the right time."" Our project helps patients get access to the most appropriate medical equipment when they need it, now with respiratory support machines and in the future with many other devices.

The only environmental impact we foresee is marginal increase in cloud computing and associated electricity use. We believe this will be more than offset by the long term decrease in number of machines required (due to our project allowing better capacity management).","46154","2020-05-11 00:00:00.000","NOT_APPLICABLE_INFORMED",,,,"Digital health","10825","Business-led innovation in response to global disruption (de minimis)","2020-04-17 00:00:00.000",,,"100.0","0",,,"0",,"0","2020-04-26 19:26:45.000","2021-10-08 21:01:37.000"
